# Whatsnew
Mr. Dependabot keeps me in touch with all recent updates 

## Idea 
With help of [Dependabot](https://dependabot.com/) I can add all libraries I work with in one `package.json` dependency files and watch all the updates daily. I'll try to highlight interesting changes below: 

### 08.10.2020
1. [Typeorm v0.2.28](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/) 
    - you can now provide `-p` option to prettify generated migrations
2. Bug fixes and typings improvements in simple-git, typeorm,  dayjs,  

### 28.09.2020
1. [Marked v.1.2.0](https://github.com/markedjs/marked/) now has `parseInline` method that parses only inline elements
(something like `**strong** _em_` in original parser would be wrapped in `<p>`, but `parseInline` won't do that).

2. Bug fixes in [DayJS](https://github.com/iamkun/dayjs), [Marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked/) and [Swiper](https://github.com/nolimits4web/Swiper)
